Ansible is a powerful configuration management and automation tool that allows you to manage and configure servers, applications, and infrastructure. Configuration management tasks in Ansible typically involve defining, deploying, and maintaining the desired state of your systems. Here are some common configuration management tasks you can perform with Ansible:

1. **Installing Packages**:
   - Use Ansible to ensure specific packages are installed on target servers, ensuring consistency across your infrastructure.

2. **Configuring Files**:
   - Manage configuration files by templating them with Jinja2 templates and deploying them to target servers.

3. **User and Group Management**:
   - Create, modify, or delete user accounts and groups on target systems.

4. **Service Management**:
   - Start, stop, restart, enable, or disable services and daemons on target servers.

5. **Managing SSH Keys**:
   - Distribute SSH keys to user accounts, allowing secure authentication and access to servers.

6. **Managing System Settings**:
   - Configure system settings, such as hostname, timezone, and system parameters.

7. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Define firewall rules and policies on target servers to control network traffic.

8. **Managing Software Repositories**:
   - Add or remove software repositories to ensure the availability of required packages.

9. **User Permissions and ACLs**:
   - Set file permissions and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to control access to files and directories.

10. **Database Configuration**:
    - Automate database setup, user management, and database schema deployment.

11. **Managing Cron Jobs**:
    - Schedule and manage cron jobs on target servers for tasks like backups, maintenance, and automation.

12. **Security Hardening**:
    - Apply security best practices by configuring security policies, disabling unnecessary services, and implementing system hardening measures.

13. **Docker Container Management**:
    - Create, manage, and orchestrate Docker containers and services using Ansible.

14. **Orchestration**:
    - Coordinate complex workflows and tasks across multiple servers, ensuring dependencies and order of operations are maintained.

15. **Monitoring and Logging**:
    - Configure monitoring agents and centralize log management on servers.

16. **Scaling Infrastructure**:
    - Dynamically scale your infrastructure by provisioning and configuring new servers or cloud instances as needed.

17. **Rolling Updates and Deployments**:
    - Perform rolling updates of applications or configuration changes to minimize downtime and ensure high availability.

18. **Managing Load Balancers**:
    - Configure load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers for improved reliability and performance.

19. **Backup and Restore**:
    - Automate backup tasks and define procedures for data restoration.

20. **Version Control Integration**:
    - Integrate Ansible with version control systems like Git for source code management and collaboration.

21. **Secrets Management**:
    - Securely manage and distribute secrets and sensitive information using Ansible Vault or external secret management solutions.

22. **Error Handling and Reporting**:
    - Implement error handling and reporting mechanisms to detect and respond to issues during configuration management.

23. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Develop and run tests to validate the desired state of configurations and infrastructure.

24. **Documentation Generation**:
    - Automatically generate documentation for your infrastructure and configurations.

25. **Compliance and Auditing**:
    - Enforce and verify compliance with security and regulatory standards through automated auditing.

These are just some of the many configuration management tasks that Ansible can handle. The specific tasks you perform will depend on your infrastructure, application requirements, and automation goals. Ansible's flexibility allows you to tailor your configuration management processes to suit your organization's needs.
